# Mario-29.11
# Overview #
Super Mario 29.11 is an adventure game, inspired by Super Mario Bros, initially released in 1983 (Super Mario Bros 2021), in combination with some features inspired by a game called, It Takes Two, which is also an adventure game, published in 2021 (Electronic Arts 2021).
Super Mario 29.11 features one main character, Mario, whose role is to avoid and get past all the obstacles in the level to get the key to the next level, which he can then use to open the door to the next level. This game consists of three levels, and as the game progresses, the levels get harders. However, the new feature is that Mario will be given a new superpower (powerup) for each of the levels that will help him finish the level successfully.
Obstacles in the game include, high normal blocks, lava blocks, spiked blocks and glass blocks. On the other hand, Mario will have three superpowers, corresponding to the three levels as follows:
1. SuperJump in Level 1
2. SuperMagnet in Level 2
3. SuperVoice in Level 3
